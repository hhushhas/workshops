Plan:

1. Audit app behavior (slides parsing, navigation, keyboard, presenter mode, theming, fonts, error/loading states) vs docs.
2. Rewrite intro-to-working-with-ai/README to be concise, visual, accurate; include version/date and feature matrix.
3. Add repo root README summarizing workshop modules and how to run intro app.
