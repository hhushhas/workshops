Check my staged changes and create a conventional commit message that summarizes the key changes, impact, and any breaking changes. Use the git diff output to identify the main themes and provide a clear, actionable title with bullet points for significant changes. Ensure the commit highlights any breaking changes and provides a clear description of the changes. Mention the number of files changes, lines added and removed in the commit message. If the user provides any extra notes, include them in the commit message. Then, commit and push.
